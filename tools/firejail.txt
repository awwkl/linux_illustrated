- isolate a process and its descendants within firejail sandbox
- provide private/virtualized view of system resources (PIDs, filesystem, users)
- restrict access to system resources and data

Main techniques:
- namespaces
- seccomp-bpf
- linux capabilities

Pros:
- simple commands for end-user
- simple configuration profiles for each application
- simple techniques (?), easy to verify it does the right thing (???)
- builds on existing features from Linux kernel
- great documentation and man pages
