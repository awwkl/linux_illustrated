            <h2>Linux || GNU/Linux</h2>
            <p>
              An operating system (OS) is the software interface between a user
              and computer hardware. It is an abstraction layer that allows
              userspace programs (web browser, text editor, media player) to
              avoid worrying about interacting with hardware (keyboard, screen,
              CPU, RAM). The Linux kernel is mostly used in combination with the
              GNU operating system. Thus, the GNU/Linux operating system (OS)
              consists of the Linux kernel (the core of the operating system)
              and GNU software packages.
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                The <strong>Linux kernel</strong> is the core of the operating
                system. It manages and allocates computer resources (CPU
                scheduling, memory management, process management, filesystem
                management, device management, networking, etc.)
              </li>

              <br />

              <li>
                <strong>GNU</strong> provides the rest of the operating system:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Toolchain used for developing applications and operating
                    systems, and compiling new source packages into binaries
                    (gcc, glibc, binutils, make, ...). This includes the GNU
                    Compiler Collection (gcc), the GNU C library (glibc), GNU
                    Binutils (assembler for assembly programs, linker for object
                    files, ...).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Base system is a set of software packages used commonly in
                    the GNU/Linux operating system. This includes bash (command
                    shell program), GRUB (bootloader), coreutils (cd, cat, ls,
                    rm, ...), and other utilities (tar, grep, sed, ...).
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>

              <li>
                And then there are <strong>other software packages</strong>,
                like web browsers and text editors. Perhaps surprising to some,
                this also includes your graphical user interface (GUI), which
                ultimately is just a set of packages. You can change your
                desktop environment/window manager easily in Linux!
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              Each distribution of GNU/Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Arch,
              etc.) is a bundle of packages that can be 'distributed' as an
              operating system, with slight differences in the kernel, GNU
              packages, and other software packages. To most users, the main
              difference will be the desktop environments and programs that are
              shipped with the distribution. This allows the different
              distributions to look so different.
            </p>

            <h2>"Everything in Linux is a file"</h2>
            <p>
              is probably the most important thing to keep in mind while
              continuing to read this article. *Almost* everything is a file,
              from the bootloader executable file, to the compressed kernel
              image, the files in the filesystem hierarchy, and the system
              manager and other software. This allows users/administrators to
              have a great degree of flexibility. Almost everything can be
              changed or added, simply by installing the desired software:
              bootloader, kernel (yes even the kernel!!), desktop environment,
              network manager, command shell, browser, and more.
            </p>

            <p>
              When your system is powered off, the operating system has to
              reside somewhere... yes, it resides on your disk storage
              (SSD/HDD). The Linux operating system resides as a filesystem
              containing executable binary files, libraries, configuration
              files. During boot process, the kernel will mount this filesystem,
              execute the init process (AKA first process, ancestor of all
              processes, system manager), which will call init scripts and
              startup other services and processes. The operating system will be
              loaded bit by bit into RAM, and eventually 'userspace' is reached,
              and you can launch your user programs.
            </p>

                >my article on the UEFI boot process</a
              >, where I explain the steps of booting, from power on to system
              initialization. The boot process can be summarized as:

              This next image presents the components of Linux in a single
              diagram. It provides an overview of how the bootloader, kernel,
              and filesystem interact. The system manager and user applications
              are just files - executables (in /bin), libraries (in /lib),
              configurations (in /etc) - "scattered" across the different
              directories in the filesystem.
            </p>

              Identify in the diagram each of the 4 main components of a Linux
              Operating System (OS):

            <h2>1. Bootloader</h2>

            <p>
              During the boot process, the bootloader stored on a specific
              partition of storage disk is executed. The bootloader then loads
              the kernel into RAM, as part of the
              <a href="../boot/boot_UEFI.html"
                >boot process described more in my article on the UEFI boot
                process</a
              >.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Kernel</h2>

            <p>
              CPUs may operate in different modes, commonly two separate modes:
              kernel mode and user mode. These are protection modes with
              differing restrictions on the types of allowed operations. These
              CPU modes are commonly enforced at the hardware level.
            </p>

            <p>
              The kernel is the core of the operating system, and operates in
              the privileged kernel mode, where it can perform unrestricted
              device/hardware management, hardware instructions and memory
              access.
            </p>

            <p>
              User processes, on the other hand, operate in user mode. User
              processes may not be able to interact directly with hardware, have
              restricted hardware instructions, and may only access memory that
              is marked as being in user space.
            </p>

            <p>
              As mentioned, kernel space sits between user space and the
              hardware. As such, user processes have to perform system calls -
              requests to the kernel to perform operations on their behalf - for
              certain operations such as read/write to file storage, or creating
              and communicating with other processes.
            </p>

            <p>
              The kernel performs the central role in the operating system, of
              managing and allocating system resources. This includes scheduling
              processes for CPU execution; allocating physical memory and
              managing virtual memory for processes; managing filesystems;
              creating, executing and terminating processes; accessing
              hardware/devices; network communication; and providing a system
              call API for user processes. Perhaps I will write an article with
              illustrations on the kernel's role soon :)
            </p>

            <h2>3. Filesystem hierarchy</h2>

            <span class="image main"
              ><img src="../images/general/linux_03.png" alt=""
            /></span>

            <p>
              The image above is from
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_filesystem"
                >Wikipedia - Unix Filesystem</a
              >
              as of 21 July 2020. The
              <a
                href="https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs-3.0.html"
                >Filesystem Hierarchy Standard by the Linux Foundation</a
              >
              provides guidelines for filesystem structure. Most Linux
              distributions follow it, with some deviations, allowing files to be placed in a
              predictable location following the standard.
            </p>

            <p>
              Each Linux distribution has their own package manager that makes
              it very easy to install, update, and remove packages. They also
              install/update/remove packages that are required by these packages
              (resolving dependencies).
            </p>

            <p>
              This means that when installing a software package, its files will
              be 'scattered' across the filesystem hierarchy. It also means that
              if a user or program is searching for a configuration file (or
              other particular type of file), it will likely be located in a
              predictable directory.
            </p>

            <p>
              These guides are targeted mostly at newcomers to Linux. The
              extensive use of illustrations is something I find most other
              guides lack. I would appreciate any feedback, and corrections if I
              have made any mistakes. Apologies in advance if I have!
