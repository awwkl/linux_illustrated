# Linux Illustrated

### - simple illustrations of Linux

#### Please view the website at https://sky-aw.github.io/Linux-Illustrated

I have found a lack of illustrations in most explanations of Linux topics out there. This website serves to provide simple illustrations and explanations on Linux, targeted for newcomers and those wishing to learn more.

These illustrations simplify the many complexities of Linux, to include only the details important to forming a solid mental model on the particular Linux subject. I focus mainly on conceptual topics that will benefit from good illustrations.
